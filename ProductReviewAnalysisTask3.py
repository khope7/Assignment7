#Task 3: Review Summary

#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

#Copying list from ProductReviewAnalysisTask1  
reviews = [
        "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
        "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
        "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
        "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
        "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
        ]

#Creating summary that appends "..."

#Concantenating list into str to slice intro for first 30 characters

for iteration in reviews:
    review_full += iteration + " "

#Slicing first 30 characters
